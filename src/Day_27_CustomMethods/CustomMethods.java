		 method: grouping a series of statements together to perform a specific tasks
		 
		 benefit of using methods is, they can make our codes reusable
		 
		 method declaration:
		 
		          access-modifier   specifier return-type  name(){}
		              public        static    void     methodname(){}
		 
		           public static void main(String[] args){
		           }
		 
  during the java course we will learn:
		
		 access-modifiers: public, protected, default, private
		 specifiers: static, abstract, final
		 return-type: void and any other data types (int, double...)
		 
  for now we will only use public and static for the access modifiers and specifiers
		 
		 return type:
		        
		        1. void methods: the methods does not return any value
		        
		 methods with parameters:
		     sometimes methods needs specific information(from the user) to perform its task, then we need to declare the method with parameters
		     Ex: Arrays.sort( array ) 
		            array is the argument, and sort method's functionality is to sort the given array
		
		parameters: can be any data type
		
		 calling methods: we call the methods by their method name
